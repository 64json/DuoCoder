# #DuoCoder
DuoCoder is inspired by Duolingo, a free language-learning platform.

It is mostly for those of you who are familiar with one programming language and want to learn another from it.

While it may not give you all the details of each programming language, our goals are ...

1.  to lower barriers for you to entry to new languages,
2.  to familiarize you with new languages swiftly, and
3.  to let you know the differences between languages at a glance.
