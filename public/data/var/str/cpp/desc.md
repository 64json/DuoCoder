## String Type Variables

1. Single character
    * Type: `char`
    * Value: `'(character)'`
    
    
2. String
    * Type: `char*`
    * Value: `"(string)"`
    * Strings in C++ are expressed as an array of characters.
    * Asterisk (`*`) after `char` lets the variable stores a memory address of the first character in the array.
    * We will talk more about arrays soon.
