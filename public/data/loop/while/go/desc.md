## While Statement

```
for condition {
    statement
}
```

1. Go does not have `while` keyword. But it can be done with `for condition {}` simply.

2. The `condition` expression is executed before every loop. If the expression is `false`, the loop ends.

3. The infinite loop looks like just `for {}`.
